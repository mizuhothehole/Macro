New point view of making macro files

So in today、s review，it seems hard for me to do the pair coding because i do not know a lot of the rules of our 
transactions and what the man want me to do. So in my point of view， it is a good way for me to remenber some methods often
used.

The for each can only be used in the collections and arrays

1.collection

For Each xxx In LLL
    xxx do something 
Next xxx

For aaa=1 To LLL.count
    do something using LLL.Item（aaa）
Next

For aaa=0 To LLL.count - 1
    do something using LLL（aaa）
Next

2.dictionary

Dim a as countor
keys = DDD.keys
items = DDD.items

For a=0 To DDD.counts-1
    key=keys（a）
    item=items（a）
    'now we can do something using these keys and values 
    key do something
    item do something
Next
