The macro basic in macrosoft vba

To see the basic functions of vba we can find a lot of courses in the internet 
And as the basic we shouldkniw the very instrumentated knowledge of the workbook object
So as the intruduction of the very complex workbook object we coykd get started with the basic 
operations right

So workbooks worksheets cells range all these object should be very known by everyday work
So the method and the properties in it should also be known a lot anyway

Then the next thing we must know is called the procedure
a procedure means a operation that is always seems the sameway for the computer operation

So a left click is a procedure a right click is a procedure and many other operations are always procedures
Then if we make some other same operations we will be sure that we are doing the same procedure

At this moment we have just learned the most useful objects and the most usedu procedures in our vba learning，
so let us go on with our learning about more programings of vba objects and procedures

The evening should be a good time for our learning，right？
