Macro learning memo
1.Date and Dateserial

Dim date1 As Date = New Date（2017，9，11，12，33，45，121）
This will return a datatype of date， also this could be
the prototype of date in VB.

2.Date date2 As Date

date2=Dateserial（2017，7，17）
this will also return a date that give us a date type. Which 
makes easier to be made.

Both 1 and 2 give us a date return value.

DateAndType module in vba runtime.dll

-------------------------------------

The next thing we need to know is the “lastrow” logic

1.Rows.Count will give us the biggest number of the current worksheet even through 
there is no data written in it.

2.Range.End（xlup）will give the endest cell.

3.End means the lastest row number of the empty rows of some excel area. It is used like 
this： Range.End（xlup）.Row

------------------------------------------------
Some other methods we need to know.

1.InStringRev：same as InStr，but count the position from the end，not the start.
2.Array.LBound ： return the low label of the array
  Array.UBound ： return the up label of the array
  
  So， what is the LBound and the UBound？
  They are from these defines：
  
  Dim aa As Variant
  ReDim aa（22 To 100）
  
  Here the low label is 22 and the up label is 100。
  
-------------/////////-------------------

The other thing is CreateObject（“Scripting.Dictionary”）

Using this will let us get a dictionary object which have the only key.

------------------------------------------

The standard For in VBA

For AAAAA =34 To 1479 Step 4
xxxxx
Exit For
xxxxx
Next AAAAA（you can also do not write this）

For Each BBBBB In VVVVV

Exit For

Next BBBBB（you can also do not write this as it is optional）
--------------------------/---------
Using the ：= means appointing the parameter of a method
