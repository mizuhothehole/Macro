Macro learning memo
1.Date and Dateserial

Dim date1 As Date = New Date（2017，9，11，12，33，45，121）
This will return a datatype of date， also this could be
the prototype of date in VB.

2.Date date2 As Date

date2=Dateserial（2017，7，17）
this will also return a date that give us a date type. Which 
makes easier to be made.

Both 1 and 2 give us a date return value.

DateAndType module in vba runtime.dll

The next thing we need to know is the “lastrow” logic

1.Rows.Count will give us the biggest number of the current worksheet even through 
there is no data written in it.

2.Range.End（xlup）will give the endest cell.

3.End means the lastest row number of the empty rows of some excel area. It is used like 
this： Range.End（xlup）.Row
